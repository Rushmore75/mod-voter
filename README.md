# mod-voter
Let's us vote for mods that we put in our modpakcs. Before we did it with discord which wasn't very user-friendly

### TODOs
- [ ] Discord login, only vote once/item
- [ ] impl [this](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/libium) so it auto-gens the pack
    - [ ] generate pack button (for anyone)
- [ ] Use real database?
- [ ] Use a "pack id" separation, so multiple packs can be built (put this as a header field?)
